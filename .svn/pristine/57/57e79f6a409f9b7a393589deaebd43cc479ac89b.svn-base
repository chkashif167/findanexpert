                                        You must have heard about the word ‘Collagen’ and its role in keeping the skin healthy. But you might not know all about it. Let us tell you about it and how beneficial it is for our bodies.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Present abundantly in our skin, Collagen is a protein that acts to keep our skin healthy and young. Found commonly in the muscles, skin, bones and tendons, collagen holds the body together and strengthens the overall structure.

                                    <h3>Types of collagen</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Usually, there are two types of collagen. These are:
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Endogenous Collagen</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        This type of collagen is synthesized within the body and is known as natural collagen.
                                        This type has various functions linked to it and its breakdown or scarcity means health problems.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Exogenous Collagen</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        It is already synthetic and enters the body from outside in the form of supplements. Exogenous collagen
                                        has its significance in medical and cosmetic uses like repairing of body tissues.

                                            Although it occurs in the entire body, but connective tissues, skin and bones are where it is mostly found.
                                          </li>
                                        <li>Types of collagen fibrils, gram-for-gram, is known to be sturdier when compared to steel. </li>
                                        <li>As we age, collagen production in our bodies tends to lower. Others factors that are responsible for declined production of collagen are smoking and exposure to UV light. </li>
                                        <li>Used in collagen dressings, it is quite beneficial in attracting newly generated skin cells to wound sites.</li>
                                        <li>All cosmetic products, especially lotions, claim to enhance the levels of collagen. However, this is quite unlikely because collagen molecules are quite large and they cannot be absorbed via the skin. </li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h3>What is collagen?</h3>

                                        A hard, fibrous and insoluble protein, making one-third of the total protein quantity present in our bodies.
                                        The molecules in most collagens are crammed to make thin long fibrils. These fibrils support the entire
                                        structure and connect the cells with each other. This way, the skin gets its strength and the much-needed
                                        elasticity.
                                    </p>

                                        According to experts, collagen has 16 different types and all these types have dissimilar functions
                                        and structures.

                                    <h3>What does collagen do?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Although various cells secrete the Collagen, but connective tissue cells are the ones that secrete collagen
                                        the most. Mainly it is found in the extracellular matrix, which is a complex network of molecules to check
                                        the properties of the tissues.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Inside the middle layer of the skin, dermis, collagen assists in the formation of fibroblast, a fibrous
                                        network of cells, where the new cells can grow. Fibroblast is important as it replaces and restores the
                                        dead skin cells.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        There are collagens that protect delicate organs in our body like kidneys, by forming protective layers.
                                        As we grow old, our bodies tend to produce less collagen. This way the structural integrity of skin starts
                                        deteriorating resulting in aging effects like wrinkles and weakening of joint cartilage.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Talking about women, they experience a huge reduction in collagen synthesis after menopause. When
                                        we reach 60 or beyond, a drastic decline in collagen production is understandable.

                                    <h3>Medical and cosmetic uses of Collagen</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        One main specialty of collagen is that it is resorbable, meaning it is easily broken down, converted and
                                        absorbed into the body. Also, it can be converted into compact solids or lattice-like gels. What makes it
                                        versatile is its broad range of functions and add to that the natural occurrence of it in the body. This is
                                        why it is considered extremely suitable for a number of medical purposes.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        For use in medical purposes, collagen can be extracted from humans, cows, pigs and sheep.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Skin fillers</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        For depletions and enhancing the skin contours, collagen injections are considered highly
                                        effective. Collagen fillers are commonly used in the cosmetic arena to get rid of aging signs
                                        like wrinkles and fine lines from the face. They are also quite helpful in healing scars.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        These skin fillers are extracted from humans, cows and sheep. However, for complete surety,
                                        skin tests are important before injecting collagen from cows. This helps is staying safe from
                                        allergies. Collagen is mostly used for filling superficial gaps whereas, fat, silicone or
                                        implants are used to fill large spaces.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Wound dressing</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Collagen is extremely useful in healing wounds as it enables skin regeneration at the site
                                        of the wound. This way, the healing is quickened and growth of new tissues is made possible.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Collagen dressing helps in healing the following conditions:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Chronic wounds that aren’t healed by any other treatment</li>
                                        <li>Rotting wounds</li>
                                        <li>Such wounds that expel fluids like sweat or urine</li>
                                        <li>thick or partial wounds </li>
                                        <li>Granulating wounds</li>
                                        <li>second-degree burns</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h3>Note</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        An important thing to notice here is that collagen dressings are not considered great for
                                        such wounds that are covered in dry eschar and third-degree burns etc. it is also not
                                        recommended for people who are sensitive to collagen sourced from animals like cows.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Guided tissue regeneration</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        To promote the growth of different types of cells in periodontal and implant therapies,
                                        experts make use of membranes based on collagen. While in oral surgeries, collagen barriers
                                        stop the fast-growing cells around the gums from shifting to a wound in a tooth. this
                                        allows for the tooth cells to regenerate.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Once the operation is done, these barriers do not need to be removed surgically as
                                        collagen-based membranes are known to aid the healing process in such cases.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Osteoarthritis Treatment</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Collagen supplements have been found to be great in treating osteoarthritis. A study on
                                        the subject stated that painful symptoms were reduced by using collagen-containing
                                        supplements. Not only this, it also improved joint function in people suffering from
                                        osteoarthritis.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        When the supplement gets absorbed, collagen builds up in the cartilage and it assists in
                                        rebuilding the extracellular matrix. However, all studies have not been in favor of
                                        collagen supplements for treating osteoarthritis.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Skin revitalization</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Various beauty products containing collagen claim that they are skin-friendly and revitalize
                                        the skin because they enhance the level of collagen in the human body. However, this fact is
                                        far from reality as the collagen molecules are large and hence cannot be absorbed in the skin.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Whatever benefit the user gets is due to the moisturizer used in the beauty product.
                                        They cannot increase the collagen level inside the body.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Prevention of collagen loss</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Laser therapy is known to heal the stretch marks as they stimulate the collagen growth,
                                        melanin and elastin. A balanced and healthy diet is responsible for producing collagen in
                                        the body.

                                    <h3>Collagen damaging factors</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        There are many factors that are responsible for lowering the levels of collagen within the human
                                        body. For keeping the skin healthy for a long time, you need to avoid these factors. Some of them
                                        are explained below:
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>High sugar consumption</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Consuming high sugar is surely going to increase the glycation rate. Glycation is a process in which
                                        sugar get connected to the proteins and form molecules scientifically known as advanced glycation
                                        end products.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        These advanced glycation end products or AGEs damage the proteins in their vicinity and make collagen dry,
                                        brittle and weak.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Smoking</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Harmful chemical ingredients present in the tobacco smoke are responsible for damaging the collagen as
                                        well as the elastin present in the skin. nicotine is the worst enemy of blood vessels as it narrows the
                                        blood vessels present in the outer layer of the skin.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Sunlight</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Sunlight containing UV rays breaks the collagen at a rapid rate. This results in the damage of collagen
                                        fibers and causes abnormal elastin to build up; it results in incorrect skin rebuilding and forms fine
                                        lines and wrinkles in the skin.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Genetic changes</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        These changes influence the extracellular matrix. Inturn, the collagen produced is less and whatever
                                        amount is produced is either dysfunctional or mutated.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Aging process</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        As we grow old, collagen production is affected. Collagen levels start depleting and unfortunately,
                                        you cannot prevent it.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        If you want your skin to be young, bones strong, muscles properly functioning and joints healthy,
                                        you need to avoid smoking, expose yourself less to the sun, follow a healthy diet and make exercise
                                        a mandatory part of your life. This way your skin will not age early and collagen production will
                                        also be satisfactory.
                                    </p>
