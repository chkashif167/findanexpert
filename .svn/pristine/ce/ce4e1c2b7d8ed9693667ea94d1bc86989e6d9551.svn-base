                                  </p>

                                  <h3>Common reasons for hair loss in women</h3>
                                  <p>
                                    Let’s now take you to some of the known and unknown reasons for hair fall.
                                  </p>

                                  <h3>Physical stress</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      Any incident or event that results in trauma like an accident, long illness, any ongoing issue in your 
                                      life or even the flu can be responsible for hair fall. This type of hair loss is known as telogen effluvium. 
                                      One thing to keep in mind is that our hair has a natural life cycle. This cycle starts with a growth phase, 
                                      then the rest phase and lastly the shedding phase. 
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                      When you are going through unending stress, this can take a toll on the hair’s growth and its overall cycle; 
                                      pushing more hair into the shedding phase. It is also noted that hair loss in women is experienced 3 to 6 
                                      months after the trauma. 
                                  </p>

                                  <h3>Good news</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      The only way out of this situation is to give yourself time to relax and soon as your body recovers from 
                                      the stress, the new hair will start growing normally. 
                                  </p>

                                  <h3>Lack of Vitamin B</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      Lack of vitamin B is another cause that can be responsible for hair thinning and falling. 
                                      This deficiency of vitamin B can be caused due to the imbalanced diet.
                                  </p>

                                  <h3>How to counter it?</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      If you are suffering from vitamin B deficiency, consuming supplements containing this specific supplement can do the job for you. 
                                      Make sure you add such eatables in your diet that are rich in vitamin B and B complex.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                      These foods are fish, meat, starchy veggies and fruits that are non-citrus. Don’t forget to add lean proteins and good fats 
                                      like avocado and nuts in your food as they are considered beneficial for hair health. 
                                  </p>

                                  <h3>Heredity</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      One main reason for hair loss in women is hereditary as well. It is important to note that the pattern hair loss in 
                                      women also known as androgenic alopecia is the female version of male pattern baldness. 
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                      If you belong to a family in which women tend to experience hair fall at an early age, 
                                      then most probably you will also go through the same. Hair thinning or loss in women is 
                                      different from men as female may not face a receding hairline, but most likely their specific areas on the 
                                      head may start to widen, resulting in hair thinning. 
                                  </p>

                                  <h3>How to counter it?</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      According to alopecia treatment UK experts, in case the hair fall is inherited, women must start using 
                                      minoxidil as this solution or spray will help in stopping the hair fall and even growing them back. 
                                      Minoxidil is available easily over the counter in the form of spray, foam or topical liquid and it 
                                      approved for hereditary hair loss in women. 
                                  </p>

                                  <h3>Protein Deficiency</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      If your diet doesn’t supply a sufficient amount of protein, you are at a loss; not only the hair loss but 
                                      your bones, skin and nails as well. Lack of protein from the diet will be managed by the body by stopping 
                                      the growth of your hair, and you definitely don’t want to be short of proteins due to its numerous other benefits.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                      According to the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD), the effects of protein deficiency on the 
                                      hair can be seen 2-3 months after a drop in protein consumption. 
                                  </p>

                                  <h3>How to counter it?</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      The solution to this problem is simple. Consume as much protein-containing food as you can. 
                                      Some great sources of protein are fish, meat, eggs. If you are a vegetarian and don’t like 
                                      meat or dairy products, you can eat leafy greens and grains fulfilling the shortage of protein. 
                                  </p>

                                  <h3>Pregnancy</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      Pregnancy for women is always a painful stage involving excessive physical stress, even in the current times, 
                                      and it can be the reason for hair loss in women. It is seen that hair loss in women due to pregnancy is 
                                      experienced once the child is delivered rather than during the pregnancy period. 
                                  </p>

                                  <p>
                                      If a new prescription from the doctor is creating any problem, communicate the problem clearly with your 
                                      doctor and talk about the option of switching to other birth control methods. 
                                      Discontinuing oral contraceptives may also be cause for hair loss in women; however, 
                                      there is no need to worry as it won’t be permanent.  
                                  </p>

                                  <h3>Anemia</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      Studies conducted on women regarding anemia suggest that one in every 10 women between the ages of 20 to 49 
                                      is suffering from anemia owing to iron deficiency. This is the most common form of anemia and it can 
                                      easily be tackled. But, you will have to consult with your physician and they will conduct a blood test 
                                      to know whether you are suffering from this form of anemia or not.  
                                  </p>

                                  <h3>How to counter it?</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      Taking any over the counter iron supplement should do the job. Some other symptoms of anemia other than 
                                      hair loss are headache, fatigue, pale skin, and dizziness, etc. 
                                  </p>

                                  <h3>Polycystic ovary syndrome</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      Polycystic ovary syndrome or PCOS refers to the imbalance of male and female sex hormones. Too many 
                                      androgens may result in ovarian cysts and can make the person overweight. Not only this, it can also 
                                      increase the risk of diabetes, can cause infertility, change the menstrual pattern and may also be the 
                                      cause of hair thinning.  
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                      Due to the over-representation of male hormones in PCOS, females tend to experience excess hair on their body and face. 
                                  </p>

                                  <h3>How to counter it?</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      Opting for PCOS treatment is the solution for correcting hormonal imbalance and can also reverse the 
                                      adverse effects faced due to it. The treatment for PCOS includes change or reinforcement of diet, 
                                      regular exercise, birth control pills and not to forget the treatment intended for infertility and diabetes.  
                                  </p>

                                  <h3>Emotional stress</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      Emotional stress is considered more dangerous for hair loss in women as compared to physical stress. 
                                      We cannot rule out this factor from a woman’s life. They may go through emotional stress due to divorce, 
                                      the death of their family member, financial struggle or being a single parent.  
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                      According to Dr. Glashofer, emotional stress may not directly affect the hair fall, 
                                      but it will act to intensify any problem that exists already. 
                                  </p>

                                  <p>
                                      Just like the physical stress, the hair loss in women due to emotional stress is going to decrease once the affected person is in full 
                                      control of her condition. 
                                      The requirement in this condition is to fight against stress and anxiety caused by any reason.  
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                      This could be done by changing the environment, your overall work schedule, opting for work out, going for talk therapy or getting 
                                      the much-needed support from people around you. 
                                  </p>

                                  <h3>Autoimmune-related hair loss</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      Also, known as alopecia areata, this type of hair loss is caused by an overactive immune system. Dr. Glashofer 
                                      states on this condition, “The body gets confused. “The immune system sees the hair as foreign and targets it 
                                      by mistake.”
                                  </p>

                                  <p>
                                      Most of the drugs used to treat cancer come with some diverse effects as well. One of the main side-effects of 
                                      these drugs is that they cause hair fall and that too at a brisk pace. Chemotherapy being a wonderful thing for

                                      cells; however, it divides the cells like hair too.

                                      A good news is that scientific researchers are looking to find new ways of treating cancer other than chemotherapy; 
                                      these ways may not have any side-effect on the hair as well as other things.

                                      Losing your weight suddenly can be termed as a form of physical trauma which may result in thinning or hair loss in women. 
                                      Hair fall can happen even if losing weight benefits your overall health. The main thing that is deemed responsible for hair 
                                      loss is that you may not be taking enough mineral, vitamins and proteins in the form of food.

                                      This is an obvious reason for hair loss in women. Women who cross their 40s start falling prey to hair loss and those who are 
                                      in their 50s and 60s are already losing hair at a rapid pace. Experts are still not sure about this phenomenon of hair loss in 
                                      women, says Dr. Glashofer.

                                      Well, you surely cannot stop aging and even experts don’t suggest any treatment for hair loss due to aging. 
                                      Those women who are reluctant for it can go for scarves, wigs and do such hairstyles that cover up their 
                                      thin spots. However, there are a number of tricks that when followed can stop the hair from breaking,

                                      of time can be responsible for hair fall. Going for tight braids, hair weaves or corn rows and using chemical relaxers for hair 
                                      straightening and heating them vigorously can damage your hair and may also result in hair fall.

                                      Certain medications may also promote hair loss. Some blood thinners and drugs used for normalizing blood pressure, 
                                      commonly known as beta-blockers are considered the worst enemies for your hair. Some other drugs that cause hair loss

                                      some tests and this will enable them to determine whether these medications should be continued, changed or 
                                      aborted. They might even lower the dose of these medicines and even then if the results are not gained then there is no option other than to switch to another option.

                                  </p>

                                  <h3>Abnegate from such hairstyles that pull the hairline</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      If you want to make sure that your hair stays intact for a long time, make sure that you make less styles like:
                                      <ul>
                                          <li>Tight ponytails</li>
                                          <li>Cornrows </li>
                                          <li>Braids </li>
                                          <li>Tight buns </li>
                                      </ul>
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                      All these styles and any others that pull your small hairs from hairline should be done less as they can 
                                      cause hair loss. The consequences of these hairstyles are too much stress and the pulling of delicate hair 
                                      ultimately resulting in the thinning of hair or hair fall. If you have no other option but to go for a 
                                      ponytail, be sure to use an elastic that is free of metal. 
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                      This way, you are ensuring that your hairs aren’t entangled in the elastic nor they are pulled out while removing the ponytail. 
                                  </p>

                                  <h3>Get rid of tools that use intensive heat</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      Make sure you keep your hair away from heat. Excessive heat makes bonds within the hair strands that result 
                                      in your hair strands getting cracked. The end result is brittle hairs that have no strength and fall 
                                      out easily. If you are using hair straighteners or curling iron, be sure that you don’t leave it on the 
                                      hair for too long.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                      Best hair transplant experts are of the view that you need to keep your hair resistant against heating irons 
                                      etc, you need to move them every 8-10 seconds. Another indicator which will tell you whether the curling 
                                      iron or straightener is too hot is the sizzling sound or burning sensation to your fingers when you touch 
                                      your hair.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                      Make sure to dry your hair naturally and if the need for using the styling tools arises, use a heat 
                                      protecting spray. This spray will lower the damage inflicted by the tools on the hair. 
                                  </p>

                                  <h3>Watch out for chemical processing</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      We are fully aware that heat can have damaging effects on the hair and scalp; however, you need to be wary 
                                      of all the chemical processes and treatments offered by salons and hair loss clinics. Usage of chemical products 
                                      on the hair for straightening, bleaching, and lightening the color not only harms the hair shaft but also weakens it. 
                                      This eventually results in hair loss and you don’t want it to happen. 
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                      According to experts at London hair clinic, women should not go for extensive coloring and should stick to 
                                      their natural style closely for as long as possible because this will make sure their hairs are intact for 
                                      longer periods of time. Also, if a woman is experiencing hair thinning, too much styling, coloring and 
                                      bleaching will make the situation worse.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
