                                        Start by figuring out your company’s marketing requirements
                                        before you select a <strong>digital marketing agency</strong>. Are you looking
                                        to establish an online presence first and then expand or you
                                        already have a well-developed website and app on which you
                                        want to thrive?
                                    </p>

                                        you are lacking in paid ads?

                                    <p>
                                        Take a close look at your team and their capabilities and ask yourself a question,

                                        business to newer heights? If not the entire strategy, what part of the marketing
                                        strategy they can carry out?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        What tactics you are aware of but you haven’t practiced them for a while or aren’t
                                        aware of the latest changes in them? Do you have a complete team that compliments
                                        each other or a segment is missing?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Above mentioned are some examples of the questions that you should brainstorm.
                                        These sort of questions will enable you to decide what part to outsource and get
                                        more fruitful results. More question marks arising in your brain, more prepared

                                    <h3>Set a meeting</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Now that you have determined your requirements and set your eyes on a
                                        <strong>digital marketing agency</strong> via Google or someone’s suggestion;
                                        the first hurdle is out of the way. Contact them via email or phone and let

                                    <p>
                                        Once they contact you, set a meeting at your desired place or visit them.
                                        It all depends on you. We suggest you to visit their office as it will
                                        enable you to get a close look at their setup, professional environment
                                        in the office and the size of the team.

                                    <h3>Questions to ask</h3>

                                    <h3>How do they run their own businesses?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Don’t forget to see or ask ‘how they manage their own operations’.
                                        This is one of the best signs that will indicate what they can do
                                        for you. If you are thinking of hiring a digital marketing company
                                        to manage your company's blog, ask them on how they do it for
                                        themselves.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Looking to hire them for complete SEO or PPC campaigns, you have
                                        the right to ask them about the strategy for ranking their key
                                        phrases in the related industry and how quickly they achieve results.
                                        Same stands true for social media promotion; ask them about it and
                                        notice closely their way of managing their own social accounts.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        If they are unable to respond with a solid answer, you are at the
                                        wrong place or dealing with an in-experienced company. It could
                                        mean that that they are not capable enough to provide the services
                                        which they should.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>What are their KPIs?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        A number of <strong>digital marketing London</strong> companies track vanity metrics.
                                        Vanity metrics are those numbers that don’t really matter in relation
                                        to revenue generation for businesses. For instance, the number of ‘likes’
                                        on a social media post or a blog post is vanity metric as it may not
                                        affect the sales.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This is the last thing you want against the money you spend every month;
                                        the number of likes on posts which don’t necessarily translate into
                                        something substantial. Ask questions like, ‘how will they measure
                                        your success, your conversion rate, the traffic you are getting and
                                        the number of visitors which are turning in to buyers or service
                                        subscribers.’
                                    </p>
                                    <p> Ask them how they will show the metrics picturing the actual return on investment (ROI). </p>
                                    <p>Below mentioned are some of the main KPIs in digital marketing. </p>

                                    <h3>Number of Unique Visitors</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        A great marketing strategy will mean loads of traffic and this, in turn, will be responsible
                                        for a boost in conversions (depending on how effective the entire marketing funnel is).
                                        In case, you haven’t worked out your target audience, directing huge traffic towards
                                        your site and figuring out their interaction with the site is a good way of measuring it.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Time spent On-Site</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        The amount of time a user stays on your site is a direct reflection of the value and relevancy
                                        of the content on it. If the visitor finds the content on your site informative, tailored
                                        for them and relevant to their needs, they are going to spend more time on the site.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        If they don’t stay, it means your content is not up to the mark or what they were looking
                                        for and it needs major tweaking. Google prioritizes this metric while ranking content as
                                        it is a clear picture of how valuable the website or blog is to a visitor who landed on
                                        the site using your key phrases.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The time spent On-Site can be tracked via the ‘average visit duration’ statistic in Google Analytics.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Traffic Source Numbers</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Another key metric is to know which channels are responsible for driving users to the site. For instance,
                                        if you get to know that a particular blog post is directing lots of traffic and it ranks quite high in
                                        the search rankings, you will definitely want to produce more content resembling the one which is liked

                                        It is also very important to measure the type of traffic you are getting on the site. Are you getting most
                                        of the traffic from referral websites? Is the traffic on the site generated by specific marketing campaigns?
                                        Are you able to achieve most of the traffic from organic search?
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Bounce rate</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Bounce rate means the visitors who leave your pages quickly after landing on them. A high bounce rate is a
                                        clear signal that the content on your site is either not informative or people don’t value it because of
                                        its irrelevancy.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        To improve the content and lower the bounce rate, you need to identify the purpose for which someone landed
                                        on your page. This will allow you to craft such content that falls upon their expectations.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Cost per click</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        CPC or cost per click is a model for paid ads. It means you will have to pay every time your ad is clicked.
                                        A high CPC rate would mean that you haven’t optimized your ads for the target audience.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Click-Through rate</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Commonly known as CTR, this metric is used to measure the number of times an ad has been clicked against
                                        the impressions it received. This allows to clearly analyze how much times your ad copy got targeted.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        A low CTR means you are not well aware of your audience and you ought to understand them better and
                                        throw some different headlines, images, copy or you may also change the entire offer as well.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Social interactions</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Are you looking to hire a <strong>digital marketing consultant</strong> for handling your social media accounts?
                                        If yes, you may want to identify some KPIs here. KPIs related to social media let you measure
                                        the efforts thumped into the social media for generating conversions.

                                    <p>
                                        If you are aware of a tool named KISSmetrics then you can easily track your customer’s journey;
                                        people who landed on your site via social media. This will enable you to track the number of
                                        buyers being generated by social media posts. This tool isn’t only limited to checking
                                        ‘likes and shares’.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>What results do they promise?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        When planning to select a <strong>digital marketing company</strong> or freelance internet marketing individuals,
                                        they may promise a lot of wonderful things to you just to catch you and have a contract knowing
                                        the fact they may lack the staff required and the abilities needed for the job.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Worst-case scenarios have seen these incompetent people charging the client heavily each month in return of a
                                        promise that it may take longer to see organic and long-lasting results.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Large and well-known digital marketing agencies are also advised not to guarantee bottom of the funnel results.
                                        The reason for it is that there are several factors involved, depending on each company, which may affect the ROI.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        For instance, if you are competing in a tight market, the results might take longer to come, even if you are
                                        doing everything right.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        While finding the best <strong>digital marketing agency</strong>, you can stay away from scammers and those relying on low-quality
                                        tactics by questioning them about their secret sauce. Why they are different? What strategies are they going to
                                        use for your business to achieve desired results?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Neil Patel is of the view that those companies which charge you low prices against promised services should not be hired. According
                                        to him, “A great SEO will never charge low prices. If you’re hunting for a discount, chances are you’ll end up with an SEO who cuts
                                        corners and hurts your site in the long run.”
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>What do they charge?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        One decisive factor for filtering out low-quality agencies is the price range. Most businesses in the market have one common goal
                                        which is to save money by hook or by crook. This makes them question the price charged for the services and this is quite normal
                                        for any company out there.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        While on your outlook for the best digital marketing agency, you may come across dozens of marketing companies and if a company
                                        that asks for a low price for their marketing services, then you may not get high-quality results.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        A simple fact is that experienced digital marketers, SEOs, creative content writers, data analysis experts have done sheer hard
                                        work in reaching a spot where they are today. It takes time, effort and education. They charge quite handsomely for their
                                        services and it is their right; nothing to complain about. However, if they ask for too low, there is something fishy; the
                                        results may not be as you are expecting. Beware of companies like these.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Also, ask them to clarify the payment structure. Will it be monthly payments or one-time payment?
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>How many clients have you served before?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        While discussing things in the meeting, don’t be afraid to ask them about the clients they have served before; their number
                                        and the fields in which they were operating. Asking for the portfolio of the company is your right and you may ask for
                                        their previous or existing client’s contacts.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Let it be the PR campaigns, making keywords rank, coming up with great content with high CTC rates and low bounce rates,
                                        going through their portfolio is considered to be a must by experts.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        If you do so, contact their clients and ask them about the services they are getting from them; the quality, results, ROI
                                        and anything that comes to your mind regarding their services. If a <strong>digital marketing agency</strong> doesn’t show you the list of
                                        the previous clients they have served, it means either they don’t have any or they are afraid that their client will
                                        disclose their bad quality work to you.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Do you guarantee results?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Almost all leading <strong>digital marketing services providers</strong> do not guarantee results in a specific time frame, whether you are in a
                                        competitive market or not. Even those companies who do promise results in a certain time frame do it when the client company is
                                        operating in a niche which has very low competition. However, this is linked to a number of ‘ifs’ and ‘buts’.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Seasoned <strong>digital marketing companies</strong> know there are too many factors involved and to achieve desired results, the time taken may vary. One important
                                        thing to notice here is that if a digital marketing agency guarantees results in a given time frame, ‘run away from them.’
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        There are no guaranteed and promised results in SEO and digital marketing. Keep one thing in mind that it is a long-term process for getting the results you wish.
                                        Patience and persistence from both sides, especially the hiring company is extremely necessary.
