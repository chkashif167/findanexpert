                                 <strong>Carboxytherapy for cellulite</strong> is a proven method to repair collagen and destroy the fatty deposits present in the different parts of the body. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 It is also deemed perfect for significantly reducing the under-eye circles. This is done by increasing the flow of blood to the eyelids. 
                              </p>

                                 When it comes to fat and cellulite reduction, carboxytherapy is a commonly used procedure all over the world in comparison to other invasive and risky processes like liposuction.
                              </p>
                              <h3>How carboxytherapy is done?</h3>
                              <p>
                                 The basics of carboxytherapy may differ based on the specific body part to be treated. However, the mechanics will still remain the same. 
                              </p>
                  
                              <p>
                                 A carbon dioxide tank is joined to a flow-regulator using a plastic tube. The flow of the gas will be closely monitored by the physician. The gas flows out via the flow-regulator into the sterile tubing which has a filter at the end.  
                              </p>
                  
                              <p>
                                 The filter is there to stop any impurity from reaching the human body. This gas then flows to the opposite side of the filter via a small needle. The expert uses this needle to inject the gas beneath the person’s skin. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 The entire procedure of carboxytherapy is painless; however, some patients may feel a strange sensation once the procedure is completed. The reason why it is completely painless is that the physicians apply numbing cream on the place of injection before inserting the needle into the skin.  
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                <strong>Carboxytherapy for cellulite</strong> is an outpatient procedure and may only take between 15 to 30 minutes for its completion. 
                              </p>
                              <h3>Fast facts about Carboxytherapy</h3>

                                This treatment makes use of carbon dioxide infusions. It is a gas that is already present in the human body.

                              </p>
                              <h3>Number of treatments required</h3>
                              <p>
                                For those who want ideal results, skin specialists suggest them 7 to 10 treatments with each treatment 1 week after the preceding one.

                              <h3>Effectiveness</h3>
                              <p>
                                According to a study conducted a couple of years ago, people who went through carboxytherapy experienced a reduction in cellulite from degree III to degree II. 
                              </p>
                              <h3>How to prepare for it?</h3>
                              <p>
                                 Although there are no particular preparation steps to follows before <strong>carboxytherapy</strong> but the physician may ask you to prepare depending on your personal conditions. 
                              </p>
                              <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                              <p>We know that poor circulation of blood is may result in cellulite, stretch marks and dark under-eye circles. 
                                 Carbon dioxide is wasted by the cells present in our body. Red blood cells are responsible for carrying the inhaled oxygen to the tissues and then gather carbon dioxide to be wasted. Ultimately the CO2 is exhaled from the lungs. 
                              </p>
                  
                              <p>
                                A physician enhances the circulation of blood to the required areas by injecting carbon dioxide which in turn causes the red blood cells rush to that area. As soon as the red blood cells reach the desired body location, they enhance the circulation of blood. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 When we talk about under-eye circles, it results in improving the skin elasticity and changing of pigment to a healthy glow.  
                              </p>
                              <h3>Stretch Marks:</h3>
                              <p>
                                 The stretch marks on your body are a result of damage to the dermal collagen. Carboxytherapy treatment helps in creating new collagen which in turn thickens the skin and improves its overall appearance.  
                              </p>
                              <h3>Cellulite:</h3>
                              <p>Another way to get rid of the fat cells is to inject carbon dioxide into them. This causes them to burst and get 
                                 removed from the body. The main cause of cellulite is the protrusion of subcutaneous fat in the body. 
                                 Modern studies have found out that carboxytherapy for cellulite is not only effective for treating cellulite 
                                 but is also a safe method to achieve the results. 
                              </p>
                              <h3>
                                Under-Eye circles:
                              </h3>
                              <p>
                                 Poor circulation of blood is mainly responsible for causing dark circles or vascular pooling under the eyes. If you want to reduce this bluish tone and replace it with a blush tone, injecting gas under the eyelid by an experienced specialist can do just that.  
                              </p>
                              <h3>Alopecia:</h3>
                              <p>
                                 It is a condition where hair loss is caused by poor circulation. Carboxytherapy has the solution to it too.  
                              </p>
                              <h3>Side effects associated with carboxytherapy</h3>
                              <p>
                                 Although there are no significant side effects of carboxytherapy and it is known as a safe procedure, however, some people opting for it may experience bruising at the site of injection, especially in the arms or legs. This bruising tends to vanish in 5-7 days.  
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 People who go for <strong>carboxytherapy for weight loss</strong> or reduction of cellulite should not bath in a bathtub or shouldn’t even let the water come in contact with their bodies for 24 hours after the procedure.   
                              </p>
                              <h3>What to expect after the treatment?</h3>
                              <p>
                                 When carboxytherapy stretch marks treatment is practiced for treating scars and stretch marks, it doesn’t cause any pain because the scar tissue doesn’t have nerves. The patient may experience some itchiness during the therapy due to the stretch marks getting swollen. This feeling of itching may go away in around 5-15 minutes. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 Patients who are undergoing this therapy for the treatment of cellulite and fatty deposits may experience some pressure during the injection, same as the feeling experienced when they are going for a blood pressure test. This sensation is caused by expanding gas.  
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                Also, after completing the treatment, the areas that are treated will feel warm and tingly for the next 24 hours. This is a result of carbon dioxide doing its job and hence improving the circulation. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                One thing to notice here is that you will be able to perform your routine work once the carboxytherapy treatment is done. In case you are unable to do it and feel any complication, contact the service provider at the earliest.    
                              </p>
