                                    <p>Before we go into the detail, let’s tell you what actually is Balayage?</p>

                                    <h3>What is Balayage?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        As I mentioned earlier, Balayage is a French word which means
                                        “to seep or paint”. Richard Ward, a famous royal and celebrity 
                                        hairdresser, says that, it is a freehand hair coloring technique
                                        known to give you a perfectly blended look.  The fact that it 
                                        has no harsh effects on the hair and with no visible re-growth 
                                        lines makes it one of the go-to hair coloring techniques. 
                                    </p>

                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Half or full head Balayage makes sure that you get
                                        sun-kissed natural looking hair that are soft and having
                                        less noticeable re-growth. While coloring hair using Balayage
                                        technique, experts follow the rule, less is more to get a
                                        natural and multi-tonal finish. </p>

                                    
                                    <p>
                                        This process involves the using of light patches and shade
                                        to form multiple dimensions of the color. Balayage is
                                        one great technique if you are looking to refresh your
                                        hair color instead of a bold color overhaul. </p>

                                    <h3>How to apply Balayage?</h3>
                                    <p>Balayage involves applying of the paint onto the surface of 
                                        the hair strands instead of saturating through the section 
                                        till the tips. This results in a natural and even blend of 
                                        color onto the hair. The reason why it is called a freehand 
                                        technique is that it doesn’t involve any caps or foils and 
                                        highlights are created freely by the expert.  
                                        </p>

                                    <h3>How long it takes to complete the procedure?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        According to Josh Wood, Creative Director at Redken Global 
                                        Colour and founder of Josh Wood Atelier, the time taken on
                                        Balayage depends on its depth as a few or small highlights 
                                        may be accomplished in a matter of minutes. On the other 
                                        hand, a complete triple process look is estimated to take 
                                        up to 3 hours. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Adding more, Josh is of the view that going for multi-tonal 
                                        layered Balayage may take more time in contrast to regular 
                                        color. Going for this application will mean that you can 
                                        elongate the breaks between two color appointments. In case, 
                                        you want a few Balayage babylights, you may need to sit for 
                                        45 minutes on the chair in front of the color stylist. 
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Why is Balayage different from other hair coloring techniques?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                       Irrespective of half or full head Balayage, this technique is quite different from 
                                         conventional highlights as it doesn’t involve any foil. Also, the main part of this
                                        technique is that it involves freehand color painting. Richard Ward says that the 
                                        result gained from Balayage is less uniform than conventional highlights. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        If you are a bit touchy when it comes to stripy hair color,
                                        Balayage is the technique that would help you to stay away 
                                        from harsh contrast between colors, especially if you have 
                                        opted for Balayage for blonde hair. The new hair color 
                                        will be bespoke to you and if you want, the stylist will do 
                                        it in a way that compliments as well as distracts attention 
                                        away from some features of your face.

                                    <h3>Why Balayage is so popular?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        A decade ago, Balayage wasn’t a significant and well-known
                                        name in hair coloring department. However, times have changed
                                        now and it is considered as a sought after coloring method 
                                        not only in the UK but the entire Europe and USA.

                                        Ward emphasizes the fact that celebrities love Balayage
                                        and this trend has been quite famously opted for the red 
                                        carpet. Well-known celebrities like Jessica Alba, Gisele, 
                                        Chrissy Teigen have endorsed Balayage and since then people 
                                        have fallen for it head over heels. Some other celebs who 
                                        love Balayage are Kim K, J LO, Jessica Biel, Olivia Palermo 
                                        and Amber Heard to name a few. 
                                    </p>

                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Salon and Spas have been flooded with people who want Balayage or touch
                                        up Balayage. And if you think that you can’t enjoy Balayage and a 
                                        striking appearance of your hair just because you have short hair, 
                                        you are mistaken. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The size of your hair doesn’t matter when it comes 
                                        to balayage; you can be the show stopper even with short 
                                        locks. In case, you are confused, just a take a look at

                                    <h3>Does Balayage require maintenance?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Compared with normal hair color, Balayage requires less 
                                        maintenance as Balayaged hair tend to grow wonderfully well
                                        and show fewer regrowth lines, says Ward. This means that 
                                        it is quite beneficial for busy and working women as they 
                                        can wait longer between two appointments.

                                        Josh Wood advocates going for babylight technique for all 
                                        those who want Balayage to stay on their hair for as long as 
                                        possible. Babylight is the most subtle color for your hair 
                                        in the current times. Josh also advises that you invest a 
                                        little in hair coloring and styling products. This is 
                                        necessary because quality products help in making your hair
                                        look fresher for a long period of time. 
                                    </p>

                                    
                                    <p>
                                        In case your hair color turns brassy after some time, you can refresh it
                                        without going for a full head balayage with a toner or gloss to have the 
                                        shine back. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Is Balayage suitable for all types/lengths of hair?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Balayage goes well with all types of hair, be it light or dark or whichever texture. 
                                        It depends on how light you require your color to be. It is not only 
                                        for straight hair but people having wavy or curly hair can also 
                                        benefit from it because it looks good on any type of hair. 
                                    </p>
                                  

                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Balayage perfectly augments hair of all lengths apart from
                                        very short or cropped hair, says Jack Howard, L’Oreal 
                                        Professional Ambassador and Marie Claire’s 2018 Colourist 
                                        of the year. Jack expresses his views about it as; 
                                        celebrities having long, textured hair enjoy it more as 
                                        it gives them a beautiful and beachy style. 
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>How long does it stay?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        One of the greatest benefits of Balayage is that it doesn’t require
                                        many top-ups as they are needed in traditional color. The perk of 
                                        blended finish is that you don’t have to visit salon/spa on short 
                                        intervals and can have longer intervals between two meet-ups.
