                                    <h3>What is lymphatic drainage?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Our lymphatic drainage system enables us to get rid of any waste present in our body. An
                                        active and healthy lymphatic massage makes use of the natural movements of smooth muscle
                                        tissue’s to eliminate the waste. However, there are some conditions that can disturb this
                                        drainage. These include:
                        </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Surgery</li>
                                        <li>Medical Conditions</li>
                                        <li>Any other damage to the system</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                        These result in building up of fluids in the lymph system and <strong>lymph node drainage</strong>.
                        </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In case you had a surgery on your lymph nodes or involving them, the physicist will
                          ask you to get a <strong>lymphatic drainage massage</strong> from a well-known and certified massage
                                        therapist. Also, there are some conditions in which getting a lymphatic massage can
                                        be dangerous. People suffering from these conditions should not go for it:
                        </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Congestive Heart Failure</li>
                                        <li>Previous history of blood clots and stroke</li>
                                        <li>Current infection</li>
                                        <li>Kidney or liver issues</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h3>Lymphedema</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        All the procedures that tend to affect the lymph or remove the nodes result in lymphedema.
                                        It only occurs near the area where a surgery is done. For instance, your lymph nodes from
                                        the left breast are removed due to cancer surgery; your left arm might be affected by the
                                        lymphedema and not the right arm.
                        </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Lymphedema may also be experienced due to health conditions like congestive heart failure
                                        or blood clots in the body. For moving the waste fluids away from the damaged area, experts
                                        suggest lymphatic drainage massage. It helps in reducing lymphedema.
                        </p>
                                    <p>
                                        DR. Raakhee Patel is an American therapist and a well known lymphedema expert and she is
                                        famous for training ordinary people to perform their own lymphatic massage once their
                                        surgery is completed. Rakhee is of the view that “We don’t talk enough about lymphedema.”
                        </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Building up of fluid in our bodies is painful and results in heaviness and discomfort.
                                        And Patel says “Stage 3 lymphedema can be devastating.” This not only results in depression
                                        but also the lack of mobility which may complicate healing.
                        </p>
                                    <p>
                                        One thing to make sure while practicing self lymphatic massage is that the massage should
                                        also be done on the region surrounding the affected area.  Our body’s complete lymphatic
                                        system, apart from the head, right side of the chest and arm, drain near the left shoulder.
                                        Therefore, a massage must include all the areas for proper drainage.
                        </p>

                                    <h3>Clearing and re-absorption</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        According to Patel, there are two stages of a Lymphatic massage; clearing and re-absorption.
                                        The first stage is known to create vacuum with gentle pressure. This brings in more fluid
                                        which results in a flushing effect.
                        </p>

                                    <h3>Clearing involves 3 regions</h3>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Supraclavicular lymph area which is to be found under the collarbone</li>
                                        <li>The axillary lymph area which is located under the arms area</li>
                                        <li>Third one is located inside the elbows</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                        One interesting thing to note here is that clearing phase can repeat itself at 10 times a
                                        day. Patel says, you should always massage both sides of the body.
                        </p>

                                    <h3>A complete guide to clearing</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Clearing has three stages. You are advised to clear the supraclavicular area, axillary are
                                        and the inner-elbow area.
                        </p>

                                    <h3>Supraclavicular area</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        For clearing the supraclavicular area, you need to be flat on a comfortable surface with
                                        your face towards the ceiling or the sky. Then cross your arms on the chest so that your
                                        hands are resting below the collarbones.
                        </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Now, lift the elbows gradually. The muscle action produces pressure which equates the
                                        pressure required for preparing the area for flushing lymphatic fluid.
                        </p>

                                    <h3>Axillary area</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Place one hand above your head and using the other hand scoop the underarm from top to
                                        bottom. The pressure applied in this situation is enough to move the skin’s surface.
                        </p>

                                    <h3>Area inside the elbows</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Start by placing your arm straight at your side. Now using the fingers of the other hand,
                                        pull the skin softly inside the elbow inch by inch.
                        </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Slight pressure is enough. You only have to work the superficial skin structure in lymphatic
                                        massage technique; this is where the fluid is present.
                        </p>

                                    <h3>Lymphatic drainage massage on legs</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        The main aim of lymphatic massage on the legs is that the lymphatic vessels are opened and
                                        fluid drains back into the lymph nodes present in the groin. Although there are many ways of
                                        performing lymphatic massage on legs, however, the purpose of all techniques is to release the
                                        fluid so that it goes back up through the lymph nodes.
                        </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Following are the steps that you need to follow for lymphatic massage on legs.
                        </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Start by massaging the upper portion of the body before starting with the legs. Closely follow
                                          the stages of clearing the supraclavicular area, the axillary area and the inner-elbow area to
                                          achieve optimal results. Clearing of these areas enable the fluid to drain up.
                              </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Use soft or slightly mild pressure. Don’t go too hard.
                              </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Commence with the leg massage at a point which is far from the affected area and proceed by working
                                            your way down. For instance, you ankle has some sort of injury or swelling, you need to begin from
                                            the upper part of the leg.
                              </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Starting from the top, your one hand should be on the inside of the leg and other should be on the back.
                              </li>
                                        <li>By applying gentle pressure, stretch the skin from the inside of the leg and keep going out and upwards.</li>
                                        <li>From the hip, start moving down, till you reach the knee.</li>
                                        <li>At this stage, stretch the skin upwards.</li>
                                        <li>Repeat this process 10 to 15 times.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                        Now, the clearing step of the lymphatic massage is done. Let’s now move on to the re-absorption phase.
                        </p>

                                    <h3>A guide to re-absorption</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        This is the second phase of the lymphatic drainage massage and to perform this, you have to follow the
                                        steps mentioned below.
                        </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Start at the affected area which is farthest from the core of the body. For instance, start from the finger tips if you have lymphedema in your hand, arm and shoulder. </li>
                                        <li>Now, use a soft sweeping motion which is sufficient for moving the surface of the skin. Move slightly from fingertip to hand, from hand to elbow and from elbow all the way to the shoulder. </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                        Patel says that patient compliance is the most difficult part of self-care, particularly for female as
                                        they are accustomed to caring for others. According to her, people must find at least 20 minutes every
                                        day of their busy schedule for lymphatic drainage massage.
                        </p>
                                    <p>
                                        When you start re-absorption phase on the legs, start by applying a pumping motion at the back of the knee and:
                        </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Place both of your hands behind the knees</li>
                                        <li>Use the pumping motion behind the knee and roll upwards. Repeat this for process for 10-15 times. </li>
                                    </ul>

                                        Once you are done, the knee can take the fluid transferred from the lower leg. Now, start massaging the lower
                                        legs:
                        </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Place one hand behind the leg and one on the top of the shin.</li>
                                        <li>Use the hands to stretch the skin in an upward motion.</li>
                                        <li>Repeat this process and move your hands towards the ankles.</li>
                                        <li>Keep on stretching gently, using the upward strokes.</li>
                                        <li>At the last step, push the fluid in your toes in the upward direction, using your fingers. </li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h3>Measuring the lymphatic massage’s effectiveness</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        At the end of all, now you would be asking one question to yourself, whether the <strong>lymphatic drainage
                              massage techniques</strong> were used rightly and was the massage effective? Patel say, “ it is a
                                        maintenance technique. In case you go for regular sessions of lymphatic massage, the lymphedema
                                        which is the target should not get worse.
                        </p>
                                    <p>
                                        It is also suggested that you increase the intake of fluids as well hydrated tissues help in moving
                                        waste, quickly.
                        </p>
                                    <p>
                                        While managing your lymphedema, you may also have to consider a couple more things. These are:
                        </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Usage of a compression sleeve for avoiding fluid buildup. </li>
                                        <li>Visiting a certified therapist for an in-house lymphatic drainage massage.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                        One thing to note here is that a good massage therapist is hard to find. When you find them, make
                                        sure to ask them about their education. Adding more, Patel is of the view that massages are great
                              for your wellbeing, however, <strong>deep tissue massage</strong> can be a bit too much for anyone
                                        with lymphedema, so just visiting a traditional massage therapist won’t do any good to you.

                                    <p>
                                        While searching for an expert, don’t just opt for someone who is masters all techniques, in fact,
                                        go for someone who is a certified lymphedema therapist (CLT) who has training in oncology and pathology.
