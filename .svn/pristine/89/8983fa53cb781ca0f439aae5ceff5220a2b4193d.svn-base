                                 A few years back, when someone wished for lengthy and sexy fingernails, acrylics 
                                 seemed to the only option. I remember the time when we were supposed to sit in a 
                                 nail spa or salon for an hour or maybe more to get our fingers shaped with a 
                                 jelly-like powder and we could never skip a fill-in once new growth was seen. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 However, times have changed for the better and now if we yearn for those long 
                                 shiny and alluring nails, we have more options to benefit from. Now we have a 
                                 number of quick fixes at our disposal like press-on nails and the latest 
                                 innovations in the nail domain like SNS dip powder and gel nail extensions.

                                 <strong>Gel nail enhancements</strong> may not be a new technique, however, regardless of its 
                                 popularity; a lot of people are still confused about it. Do you also belong 
                                 to this group of people who are unclear about the entire idea of gel extensions?

                                 We are going to share the in-depth knowledge and experiences of a well-known celebrity 
                                 manicurist <strong>Gina Edwards</strong> who enlightened us about the wide spectrum of nail gel techniques. 
                                 These techniques are important to know before you book your next appointment for nail care.

                              <h3>What are Gel Extensions?</h3>
                              <p>
                                 Before we proceed with this, you need to keep in mind that <strong>gel nail extensions</strong> are not 
                                 totally similar to acrylics or <strong>acrylic nail extensions</strong>, however, some aspects of these are 
                                 identical. Acrylic involves two steps; liquid and powder, dried by air. <strong>Gel extensions</strong> 
                                 make use of structure gel or hard gel and are curved using a UV or LED light, says Edwards. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 When it comes to gels, Hard Gel is known to be durable and commonly used as compared to the gel used for 
                                 extensions. The hard gel takes more time to be removed. Edwards says that, Structural gel is easily soaked 
                                 off and is best for those having natural nails and who desire to enhance the durability of nails without 
                                 the hardness and heaviness of hard gel. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 The structural gel acts as a cap for the natural nail, however, it may not be strong like the hard gel. 
                                 In contrast, hard gel is the toughest of all gel polishes and it is responsible for more sturdy and 
                                 long-lasting results. 
                              </p>

                              <h3>Application</h3>
                              <p>
                                 Gel extensions, just like acrylics need an overlay for lengthening of the nail. According to Edwards, 
                                 using a form under the nail assists in creating the shape and length that you are looking for. Once 
                                 the form is applied under the nail adheres, now is the time to apply the hard or structural gel all 
                                 over the nail from cuticle to the tip, and then it is cured under a lamp. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 Once this is done, the other processes of your manicure appointment will go on as normal.  The 
                                 specialist will now apply a soft gel polish which will be cured layer after layer. If you want 
                                 some nail art to enhance the beauty of your nails, the artist will decorate the tips followed by 
                                 the sealing of nails with a gel coat on top.  
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 If you desire a fresh set of extensions, you may have to spend more than an hour in the spa chair. 
                                 Edwards emphasizes that this process should not be hastened. So, before booking an appointment for 
                                 nail art make sure you can spare 1-2 hours as this is the time that may be served in this process. 
                              </p>

                              <h3>How are they removed?</h3>
                              <p>
                                 If applied correctly, the <strong>gel nail extensions</strong> must last for 2-4 weeks. This time period can go 
                                 beyond as well depending on how long you can persist with the grown-out look. Edwards is of the 
                                 view that to preserve the natural strength and health of your nails, removing of gel nail extensions 
                                 the right way is quite crucial. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 Don’t try to remove the <strong>gel extensions</strong> at your home; all by yourself. Edwards says that just because 
                                 gel polish is applied on your nails, doesn’t mean that these extensions can be soaked off like a regular 
                                 UV-light manicure. Remember that hard gel is quite tough to be removed with foils and acetone. It is a 
                                 professional process and experts break through the top seal with the help of a nail drill to completely 
                                 remove them. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 Edward recommends that almost 90% of the gel should be drilled off, and then you can soak your nails in acetone 
                                 to remove the remaining product and dust it off using a nail file. She also says that you should give your nails 
                                 some time to grow back before you have them completely removed. Don’t go for gel removal too soon as this can 
                                 weaken the nail. Let them grow out or get a fill. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 The fingernails process resembles acrylics. The manicurist will buff and drill where they see growth appearing 
                                 on the nail to make sure that the surface is smooth. Once it is done, they will apply some more gel which will 
                                 treat the freshly buffed tip. 
                              </p>

                              <h3>Are these techniques safe?</h3>
                              <p>
                                 A lot of people are concerned about the safety and health factor of these nail techniques and ask us questions 
                                 about the reliability of these techniques. The answer to their concerns is that almost all nail enhancement 
                                 techniques raise questions about safety and <strong>gel nail enhancement</strong> is no different. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 Edwards clearly says that any nail enhancement technique is accompanied by some risks and these risks are more 
                                 certain when the manicurist uses a wrong method of application or when people remove these enhancements by themselves 
                                 without expert supervision. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 Whenever you apply something on the surface of the nails, the risk of harming its firmness comes with it, says Edwards. 
                                 If you want to keep any issue at bay it is important to find a well-known spa/salon and a professional who has years of 
                                 experience under their belt. When searching a seasoned expert online, make sure that you go through the reviews about them. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 Lastly, make sure that you are moderate when it comes to applying gels to your nails. Take breaks between <strong>gel extension</strong> 
                                 techniques to allow your nails some rest and growth. Always follow the advice of your nail manicurist; they are professionals 
                                 and know a lot about their field.
