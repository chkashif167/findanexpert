                                        Since the ancient times, massages are known to be great for treating various conditions.
                                        Their effectiveness against certain physical
                                        and mental issues has been worthwhile. The health benefits and pleasure
                                        associated with massages gives them an edge over even the latest treatments. However, in the
                                        current times choosing the right one for your needs can be a bit dodgy.

                                        There are so many therapies out there that you just find yourself lost
                                        in which massage treatment to go for and which to leave, which is going to
                                        benefit your condition and which doesn’t compliment your
                                        physical or mental needs.

                                        one that is perfect for them. They are always asking about

                                        In these fast times, when the competition is so tough and survival has
                                        become hard, everyone is always occupied and seldom find times for

                                        minds as well. This is where you need to liberate yourself from the

                                        make you feel as if you are lying on the soft clouds.

                                        It means rhythmic tapping, fast percussion movements
                                        such as chopping (Karate Chops) or slight pounding.

                                        These movements are useful
                                        for warming the muscle tissues and also loosen the adhesions and muscle knots.

                                        Being a soft treatment as compared to other massages like deep tissue or sports massage, <strong>Swedish massage therapy</strong> is deemed great for all those who seek muscle relaxation,

                                    <p>
                                        Another relaxing massage that not only helps you relax but also eases your stretched muscles. <strong>Hot stone massage</strong> is considered great for healing the damaged soft tissues in the body. In this treatment, the therapist places warm and smooth stones on various parts of the body. The specialty of these stones
                                        is that they are made of Basalt, a volcanic rock which is known to retain heat for a long time.

                                    <p>
                                        The therapist also massages your body using these warm stones.
                                        The rubbing of stones on your body feels like caressing of smooth roller

                                        and you will also be excited to experience it as it is a lot more invigorating when compared to other
                                        ordinary massages.

                                        All this is enabled by the warmth of the stones that allow you
                                        to get your focus back. In hot stone massage therapy, the heat
                                        transferred by the flat and smooth rocks all along your back and
                                        shoulders enables to release the tension resulting in the muscles
                                        working more efficiently.

                                    <p>Heated rock massage is considered best for getting your focus back.
                                       It also refreshes your inner layers of skin by releasing the muscle
                                       tension, endowing you the much-needed relaxation.

                                    <h3>Chair massage</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        You must have these comfortable contraptions in different malls,
                                        salons, airports, nail parlors and even some offices. The therapists
                                        ask you to sit in this long chair in a way that enables them to easily
                                        reach for your neck, face and shoulders.
                              </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The best thing about <strong>chair massage</strong> is that you don’t have to be nude and there are no oils used in this
                                        technique. The con of it is that the therapist is unable to give you a full-body massage combined with the fact that
                                        it is done in public places; it can be distracting and not as relaxing as you thought it to be.
                              </p>
                                    <p>
                                        One thing is for sure that if a chair massage is done right, it can get rid of all the tension from your upper body.<strong> Chair massage</strong> is
                                        best when you are short of time. It can save a lot of time and you don’t have to plan for it.

                                        Let’s now move on to rubbing techniques that are quite helpful in treating pain and severe conditions.
                                        Above mentioned conventional therapies are wonderful for giving you relief from stress and provide you
                                        the much-needed relaxation. However, when we talk about severe muscle
                                        knotting or you are suffering from specific ailments, more targeted massages should be heeded to.

                                    <h3>Deep tissue massage</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        The name, <strong>Deep tissue massage</strong>, says it all. It involves applying deep pressure on the patient’s
                                        specific pain points. You may feel it a bit severe and harsh on your body as the therapist will apply
                                        rigorous pressure on your knotted muscles. Also, when the process is complete you will feel a bit sore.
                              </p>
                                    <p>
                                        One thing to mention here is that the <strong>Deep Tissue Massage</strong> technique is not all about more
                                        pressure and pain, but it is a methodical treatment to get rid of pain and muscle knots using specific
                                        techniques like tapping or pounding using knuckles and elbows.

                                        According to Dr. Randy Moyer of <strong>moyerwellness.com</strong>, in Deep Tissue Massage
                                        the experts have to use elbows and knuckles to “strip out” the muscle tissue
                                        down to the bone as much as they can. It may feel painful but when seen from a
                                 long term perspective; <strong>Deep Tissue Massage</strong> Benefits are many.

                                        Adding more, Moyer was of the view that this modality is not for
                                        everyone, but there is an extremely large popularity of people all
                                        around the world who go for this treatment for the results it
                                        possesses and never opt for any other treatment.

                                        This modality is ideal for athletes and people who indulge in
                                        laborious tasks; because their bodies perform hard tasks as compared
                                        to normal persons. Those people who are undergoing physical therapy
                                 must also heed to <strong>deep tissue massage</strong> because it helps in breaking
                                        down of scar tissue and lastly anyone having dense tissues.

                                        One thing you need to have in mind is that the therapists are always open to
                                        your suggestions about pressure exerted. In case, you want them to lower the pressure as it is
                                        too deep and unbearable, you need to communicate with them. Same is the case when it comes to
                                        increasing the pressure.
                              </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Most people require more pressure in certain areas as compared to other parts.
                                        This is due to muscle tissue containing trigger points is more susceptible to pressure
                                        and can be tender to the touch. Deep tissue massage therapy is not the one you need to have in case
                                        you are looking for relaxation during and shortly after the procedure.

                                        Resembling Deep Tissue Massage, Trigger Point Massage targets some specific parts of the human body and doesn’t involve the entire body. Here, the massage therapist will
                                        identify the exact muscle where the problem lies and uses deep pressure to bring the required relaxation.

                                        According to <a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/">VeryWell Health</a>, <strong>Trigger Point Massage therapy</strong> is an optional procedure which not only
                                        focuses on detecting the areas where the problem lies but also releases the
                                        trigger points. Trigger points are present in the skeletal muscle and when compressed,
                                        they are known to produce pain. It has been seen that trigger points are caused as a result of
                                        trauma to the muscle fibers.

                                        This pain treating therapy is also known as <strong>myofascial trigger point therapy</strong>.
                                        Techniques that are used to release trigger points include massage therapy, dry needling and chiropractic care.

                                        Trigger point massage therapy and deep tissue massage are quite similar to each other.
                                        The only difference between them is that deep tissue massage involves a number of conventional
                                        massage techniques for treating and relaxing the tissues, on the other hand, trigger point
                                        therapy is all about manipulating or firmly pressing a spot that helps in relieving the
                                        tension from the entire area.

                                        Also known as the subset of trigger point massage, neuromuscular
                                        therapy involves applying of pressure on those areas where the person
                                 has muscle spasms—muscles that hurt even while touching. <a href="https://www.spine-health.com/">Spine
                                 health</a> explains this phenomenon as, ‘this form of massage is deemed quite effective for curing the back pain caused by soft tissue injury and this fact has been recognized by The American Academy of Pain Management’.

                                        Although the pressure applied on muscle spasms in <strong>neuromuscular therapy </strong>is
                                        concentrated but it is of varying levels. The therapist usually uses their fingers,
                                        elbows or knuckles depending on the severity of the muscle spasms. When this therapy is practiced, the applied pressure must not vary for 10 to 30 seconds.

                                        it involves applying of pressure with fingers. The therapy is based
                                        on gentle stretching and combined with applying of pressure using fingers on certain pressure
                                        points. The main idea behind Shiatsu is that the flow of energy gets disturbed within the body and
                                        this massage fixes the imbalanced flow of energy.

                                        According to <a href="https://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-health/prenatal-massage/">What to expect</a>, A Pregnancy Massage is often given to a would-be mother
                                        once she has past the first trimester and her physician has cleared it. However,
                                        one thing to keep in mind is that the prenatal massage has to be given with extreme
                                        care as compared to other massages.

                                        The main thing considered in the pregnancy massage is the position
                                 of the women’s body. An expert <strong>Prenatal Massage Therapist</strong> will
                                        be aware of a position that is safe, comfortable, and beneficial when
                                        compared to bringing out the best possible results. They will place the pillows
                                        or cushions at the right place to take the pressure off.
