                                  <h3>Reasons for hair loss in men</h3>
                                  <p>If you're starting to go bald, it could feel like you're losing a piece of your identity. Understanding the cause of your excessive hair loss can help you determine which treatment option is right for you and whether your hair will grow back or not. Some main reasons for hair loss in men are explained below</p>
                                  
                                  <h3>Surgery or Illness</h3>
                                  <p>One of the foremost hair loss causes could be the surgery that you underwent recently. In case, you are recovering from a serious ailment; you can experience hair loss. One notable fact is that many people start losing hair a few weeks after they have undergone major surgery or an illness. </p>
                                  <p>At first, you may feel as if the hair may not grow back, however, experts say that the hair loss in men is a reaction to any surgery or severe ailment and they will grow once you are have recovered; after some time. </p>
                                  
                                  <h3>Medication</h3>
                                  <p>Medication after a major injury or disease can also play its part in making the men bald. Anticoagulants and most of the chemotherapy drugs used to cure cancer can be responsible for hair loss. Once the medication phase is over, hairs tend to come back. </p>
                                  <p>If you are a patient of stress and depression, taking anti-depressants can cause hair thinning. Not to forget excess of vitamin A is not good for the hair.</p>
                                  
                                  <h3>Heredity or family history</h3>
                                  <p>Heredity is another of the many hair loss causes experienced quite commonly. This male-pattern baldness can be seen due to aging and in predictable patterns or patches; a thinning hairline, bald spots, etc. You are more vulnerable to hair loss if it is in your family. Till now, no trustworthy treatment has been devised to counter genetic hair loss.</p>
                                  <p>Male pattern baldness is known as androgenetic alopecia in medical terms and activated by the genes inherited from your parents.</p>
                                  
                                  <h3>Medicinal side-effects and supplements</h3>
                                  <p>Certain medicines come with their side-effects. In the process of treating one disease, they create problems for our scalp in the form of hair loss. These diseases are MDR TB, cancer, arthritis, cardiac problems, high blood pressure, depression and gout, etc. Some food supplements are also known to speed up hair loss in men. People who use supplements, especially who are looking to amass muscles must be aware of their side-effects.</p>
                                  
                                  <h3>Hormonal Imbalance</h3>
                                  <p>You must be aware of Testosterone. It is deemed responsible for muscular growth, deeper voice and sexual arousal, etc. Medical experts say that hair loss is seen when a male’s body changes testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The reason for it is that DHT shrinks the follicles and this narrowing of hair follicles results in hair thinning.</p>
                                  
                                  <h3>Thyroid issues</h3>
                                  <p>A lot of people lose hair because they are suffering from either hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. These conditions force the speeding up of the conversion of testosterone to DHT. Those patients who are going through thyroid treatment may not be resistant to loss of hair caused by their condition. </p>
                                  
                                  <h3>Impulse Control Disorder</h3>
                                  <p>A number of people especially those in teens fall prey to Impulse Control Disorder in which they feel the urge to scratch their scalp vigorously and pull out their hair, without knowing the consequences. Also, known as Trichotillomania, this affects 2-3% of adults and teenagers. If you are a parent and see your kids pulling their hair unconsciously while studying or watching a thrilling game of soccer etc, talk to them so that they can give up on this habit which can have adverse effects on them in the future.</p>
                                  
                                  <h3>Stress</h3>
                                  <p>If you are going through a lot of stress, let it be work pressure, going through tough personal problems or anything else, you can be prone to hair loss. Excessive stress, let it be physical or emotional, can be the reason for hair loss in men. Not only this, but it also affects the growth of new hair in men.</p>
                                  <p>Hair loss due to stress is not long-term or permanent and things can come back to normal once the stress is over.</p>
                                  
                                  <h3>Excessive styling</h3>
                                  <p>Over styling and opting for tight hairstyles is also bad and affects the root of the hairs. We are not saying you shouldn’t go for ponytails, braids and cornrows, etc, but you need to be sensible and shouldn’t keep them for long periods of time. Hair, when pulled tightly can cause hair loss known as traction alopecia.</p>
                                  <p>Also, chemical relaxers for hair straightening, heating them using hot irons or curlers can damage the hair, hot oil treatments aren’t deemed good for hair follicles. Excessive blow-drying must also be abnegated and drying the hair naturally must be the preferred option. Usage of plastic combs must also be stopped for longer life of hair.</p>
                                  
                                  <h3>Alopecia</h3>
                                  <p>Alopecia, also known as alopecia areata, is a medical condition which is caused by stress. It is responsible for hair fall in round patches not only on the head scalp but also on the body as well. The reason behind this hair fall from the head and from all over the body is that the immune system attacks hair follicles.</p>
                                  <p>Around 5% of males are supposed to face hair loss on their entire scalp. In normal circumstances, the hair come back, however, this problem can reoccur again.</p>
                                  
                                  <h3>Fungal infections</h3>
                                  <p>There are some kinds of fungal infections which can also disturb the hair growth and result in hair loss in men. Thinning of hair may also indicate an underlying disease like lupus or diabetes etc. One thing to keep in mind is that sometimes the obvious reason for excessive hair loss cannot be known and it is advised that you consult a physician for identifying the real cost of this problem.</p>
                                  
                                  <h3>Hair fall symptoms</h3>
                                  <p>Hair loss can be experienced due to many reasons. Some can attack the scalp pretty quickly while others affect the hair gradually. Some types of hair fall are considered permanent and some temporary.</p>
                                  <p>Moving on from the reasons, let’s now discuss the signs and symptoms of hair loss in men.</p>
                                  
                                  <h3>Slow thinning of hair on top of head</h3>
                                  <p>Deemed as the most common type of hair fall, it is known to be found in both male and female.

Mainly this type of hair loss in men targets the scalp only; however, some men also experience it in their beards or eyebrows. Some men feel itchiness and small pain in the area before the hairs fall.</p>
                                  
                                  <h3>Quick loss of hair</h3>

                                  <h3>Hair loss from the entire body</h3>
                                  <p>There are some medical conditions and treatments that result in full-body hair loss. These types include chemotherapy treatment for curing cancer. Once the treatment is over, the hairs tend to come back. However, you shouldn’t’ take hair fall caused by medication, too easy.</p>
                                  
                                  <h3>Scaling patches over the scalp</h3>
                                  <p>This symptom represents ringworm. It doesn’t affect on its own, in fact, it comes with broken hair, redness and swelling of scalp and oozing as well.</p>
                                  
                                  <h3>Time to consult a physician</h3>
                                  <p>If you or your loved one is suffering from any type of hair loss mentioned above, you need to talk to a doctor for best hair loss treatment specifically researched for that particular type.

                                  <h3>Ways to stop hair loss in men</h3>
                                  <p>Let’s now talk about the ways that can help stop or at least reduce the hair loss so, that you are in full control of this integral part of your personality. Once the hair is lost, your personality won’t be the same. Take care of them today, before it’s too late.</p>
                                  
                                  <h3>Use mild shampoos</h3>
                                  <p>Washing your hair regularly is one of the best ways of stopping hair loss as this keeps the scalp as well as the hair, dirt and sebum free. Regular wash also keeps the scalp free from infections and dandruff, which can result in hair loss or breakage. However, you need to use a mild shampoo for your hair and not something that is full of chemicals.</p>
                                  <p>Chemicals tend to damage the roots as well as the follicles, resulting in hair loss for men as well as women. Choose a herbal or baby shampoo as they don’t contain any harmful chemicals.</p>
                                  
                                  <h3>Vitamin for hair loss</h3>
                                  <p>Make sure your intake of vitamins is balanced. Vitamins are not only beneficial for your hair but they are also great for your overall health. Vitamin A is known to produce healthy sebum in the scalp, Vitamin E normalizes the circulation of blood in the scalp, this enables follicles to be in better health. Vitamin B helps in maintaining the right color for your hair.</p>
                                  
                                  <h3>Beware of protein deficiency</h3>
                                  <p>Just like vitamins, proteins are extremely vital and not getting enough quantity of protein can have adverse effects on your hair. If you face protein deficiency in your diet, the body will automatically manage it by stopping the supply of protein to your hair to fulfill other functions. This may stop the healthy growth of hair.</p>
                                  <p>We suggest you include lean meats, fish, soy, and grains, etc in your diet so that your hairs grow normally and don’t fall out. Experts are of the view that hair fall or damage due to lack of protein is seen 2-3 months after the body feels the scarcity of proteins.</p>
                                  
                                  <h3>Scalp massage with essential oils</h3>
                                  <p>One of the most productive ways of stopping hair loss in men is massaging your scalp with essential oils, 2-4 minutes, every day. This not only eases the tension in the scalp but it also aids in normalizing the blood flow and keeps the follicles active. Oils like sesame, lavender and almond oil are considered best for scalp and follicles.</p>
                                  
                                  <h3>Don’t brush hair while wet</h3>
                                  <p>Once you have come out of the shower, bathtub or a pool, make sure you don’t brush your hair. This is the time when they are weakest and combing/brushing them in this state may result in hair fall. However, if you are in a hurry and can’t wait for your hair to dry, make sure you use a wide-toothed comb.</p>
                                  <p>It is also advised that when your hairs are wet, entangling them using your fingers is the best option you got.</p>
                                  
                                  <h3>Onion, Garlic, or ginger juice</h3>
                                  <p>Rubbing any of the above-mentioned juices on your scalp has been known to be beneficial for hair. Although there is no scientific research backing this method, but it has been quite productive for decades. Rub any juice on your scalp and leave it overnight. Wash them in the morning and you will see noticeable results.</p>
                                  <p>You or people around may not like the odour of these juices, but when seen from the long-term perspective, you have to do it.</p>
                                  
                                  <h3>Stay hydrated</h3>
                                  <p>Staying hydrated has a number of benefits other than the growth of your hair. When talking about hair, the hair shaft is composed of one-quarter water; this makes it compulsory for you to drink at least 8 glasses of water in a day to keep yourself hydrated. This hydration makes sure that your hair stay healthy for a long time.</p>
                                  
                                  <h3>Abnegate from alcohol</h3>
                                  <p>Using alcohol has been linked to hair loss in men and experts say that if you want to lower the hair fall, lessen the consumption of alcoholic. Alcoholic people tend to get bald early as compared to those who stay away from it. So, if you want your hair intact and voluminous, stay away from alcohol or at least decrease its intake.</p>
                                  
                                  <h3>Rubbing of green tea on your hair</h3>
                                  <p>Some credible studies state that using green tea controls hair loss in men. The entire process is pretty much simple. Start by brewing two green tea bags in a cup of hot water. Once the water cools down, apply it on your head and rinse off thoroughly after an hour. For best results, repeat this process for a week to 10 days.</p>
                                  
                                  <h3>Use your blow-dry sensibly</h3>
                                  <p>Know that blow-drying your hair regularly or every day isn’t going to do any good to your hair. We know that most men do not use blow-dryers, however, before going to a party/function or in the winters the use of blow-dryers increases manifold in men as well. Avoid the usage of blow dryers and let your hair dry naturally. Also, using rubbing your hair in a towel to dry is not the right way to dry them.</p>
                                  
                                  <h3>Say no to smoking</h3>
                                  <p>Male pattern baldness is not only caused by smoking but once you are suffering from it, lighting up also makes it worse. Smoking tobacco lowers the blood flow towards the scalp and this lessening of blood stops hair growth.</p>
                                  
                                  <h3>Physical activity</h3>
                                  <p>It is an accepted fact that in the current times we seldom find times for any physical activities and exercise. Taking time from your busy schedule and indulging in any physical activity like regular walk, work out, running, swimming, riding a bicycle, etc aids in balancing the hormones.
