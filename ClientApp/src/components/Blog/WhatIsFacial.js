                                    <h3>Important Note</h3>
                                    <p>If you have sensitive skin, talk about it with the aesthetician before the facial and ask them to abnegate the usage of any chemicals. The face massage expert will then opt for organic products extracted from plants and herbs etc. Or they will use products that come from the sea or clay. All the natural ingredients used in the facials have absolutely no side-effects for the sensitive skin.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>The first line of defense</h3>
                                    <p>Healthy skin is considered to be your body’s first line of defense against harmful diseases, bacterial viruses and infections. Therefore it becomes necessary to take optimal care of your skin. Taking care of your skin becomes even more significant when weather changes happen during the year as the skin has to get accustomed to the weather changes, change in diet and surroundings, etc.</p>
                                    <p>This is where your knowledge comes into play like which products are useful for your skin in providing the necessary nutrients and what quantity must be used to keep it healthy.</p>
                                    <p>Let’s now move on to the business end of this blog and tell you what a facial is.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>What is Facial?</h3>
                                    <p>A facial or face massage is not limited to applying a moisturizer on your face and putting a couple of cucumbers on your eyes. It is much more than this.</p>
                                    <p>A facial is a complete facial treatment, including different steps, done by a specialist to care for your face and neck skin. Normally, this multi-step process consists of the following steps:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Cleaning</li>
                                        <li>Toning</li>
                                        <li>Exfoliating</li>
                                        <li>Moisturizing</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>These processes are done by the use of cleansers, gels and face washes, followed by skin moisturizing and a soft face massage. All this is done by considering your age, skin type. The finishing touches are given by a mask which gives a glow to the skin.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>Necessities of a good Facial?</h3>
                                    <p>A good facial is the one that involves applying a suitable mask on the face and neck and uses a good moisturizer for hydrating the skin. This mask acts as a purifier and eliminates the pores that can be seen with the naked eye.</p>
                                    <p>Other necessities involved in a good facial are extractions, the use of toners and facial massage.</p>
                                    <p>This results in a young, rejuvenated and healthy-looking skin that influences your confidence and self-esteem as well. What else do you want?</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>Why Facials?</h3>
                                    <p>You know that your face is always exposed to the harsh weather conditions and other elements like scorching sunlight, dry winds, chilly weather, and dust, etc. So, in order to preserve the exuberance of the sensitive facial skin, you need to take extreme care of it. One way to do it is through deep cleansing and facial moisturizing.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>Basic components of a good facial</h3>
                                    <h3>Deep core cleansing</h3>
                                    <p>This is known to the first part of the facial treatment. Your aesthetician will use such products on your face that will deeply cleanse the skin without disturbing the natural mechanism of it which is based on essential pH oils and lipids that keep the skin healthy.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>Skin Analysis</h3>
                                    <p>This is the second phase done in a professional facial. Considered as a significant part, a skin analysis is used to determine the type of your skin and the skin conditions you have. This process also enables the aesthetician to figure out which products will be beneficial for you in the next processes.</p>
                                    <p>Leading aestheticians are well versed with the techniques used in figuring out the types of skin. The examining of the skin under a magnifying lamp is combined with continuous touching of the skin. While the process of skin analysis is done, they will be discussing what they see and may ask you some questions as well.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>Exfoliation</h3>
                                    <p>Exfoliation involves the removal of top layer containing dead skin. This step has its significance since the generation of new skin cells is continuous. However, with the passage of time, these cells become old and die. The dead cells need to be removed so that they are replaced by new and healthy ones.</p>
                                    <p>The process of cell regeneration is dependent on our age. As we grow old, the process also becomes slower. When it becomes slow, the dead cells start accumulating on our skin, giving it a dull and dry look. This is where exfoliation comes into play. It removes the old cells and makes way for the new, healthier cells. In turn, you get a youthful and fresh skin; you always wanted.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>Extractions</h3>
                                    <p>Once the exfoliation process is done, extraction is the next step in facial massage. This step involves the removal of congestion of the pores like whiteheads and blackheads. Here, you need to get the extractions done by a licensed professional as they are well aware of best practices used in removing the impurities. They are also aware of how to handle the skin once these impurities are removed.</p>
                                  
                                    <h3>Massage</h3>
                                    <p>Here comes the relaxing part of the facial treatment. Massage is known to be an integral part of any facial because it not only stimulates blood circulation but also promotes the much-needed relaxation by bringing oxygen to the skin. Regular facial massage results in ideal skin having the following traits.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Calming</li>
                                        <li>Moisturizing</li>
                                        <li>Purifying</li>
                                        <li>Stimulating </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Take the example of clay masks; they are excellent in removing impurities and sebum from oily and acneic skin. Masks with aloe vera extracts and alpha hydroxyl acids penetrate deep into the skin and provide hydrating and anti-aging benefits.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>Toning and hydration</h3>
                                    <p>This is the last part of your facial treatment. Here, the aesthetician will take the help of toner for restoring the skin’s natural pH. This step is also significant in preparing the skin for absorbing the moisturizer. Once the toner part is finished, the beauty expert will then apply a moisturizer on your skin.</p>
                                    <p>Regardless of the skin type and pH, a moisturizer is extremely essential for your skin and is an integral part of any skincare kit. The main purpose of it is to prevent the skin from dryness and rough look giving it the much needed hydrated look.</p>
                                    <p>One important thing to note here is that even if your skin is oily, it stills needs water and moisturizer. In case, you have oily skin, an oil-free moisturizer is what you need to have in your kit.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                                    <p>Going for regular facials from well-known spas and aestheticians will do a world of good to your face and skin. You will feel fresh like never before and a youthful appearance will enhance your personality big-time.</p>
