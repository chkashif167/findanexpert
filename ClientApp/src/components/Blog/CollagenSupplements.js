                                  <h3>What is collagen?</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      Collagen is the most abundantly found protein in our bodies. Being the main component of connective tissues, 
                                      making body parts, it is found in fats, ligaments, tendons, muscles and skin.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                      Collagen acts to fit together the pieces of our body and is quite significant in providing the much 
                                      needed strength to the bone structure. When its levels are healthy, collagen gives a strong and youthful 
                                      appearance to the cells containing it.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                      Recent times have seen a boost in collagen supplements and most of these supplements are hydrolyzed. In simpler words, the collagen gets broken down and makes it easy to absorb it. When it comes to natural foods known to increase the collagen level, pork skin, meat, leafy greens and bone broth are at the forefront.
                                  </p>
                                  <h3>Health benefits of collagen</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      Experts suggest that collagen consumption has a number of health benefits associated with it and they range from improving skin health and texture to relieving joint pain. In this blog, we have compiled some other health benefits of collagen that are backed by science.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                      Let’s get rolling
                                  </p>
                                  <h3>Improved skin health</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      Collagen is one of the main elements of our skin. It strengthens the skin and also enhances the elasticity and hydration. While we grow old, there is a sudden drop in the production of collagen which leads to the appearance of aging sign like fine lines, wrinkles and dry skin.
                                  </p>

                                  <p>
                                      Various studies have found that collagen peptides and supplements significantly slow the aging process of the skin and this way your skin remain young for longer periods of time.
                                  </p>

                                  <p>
                                      A study conducted on women found that those women who were fed on collagen supplements of 2.5-5 grams for eight consecutive weeks had fresh skin with no signs of dryness. These women also experienced considerable increase in skin elasticity as compared to those who were not fed with collagen supplement.
                                  </p>

                                  <p>
                                      Experts at the University of Colorado stated that collagen supplement’s anti-wrinkle qualities are due to its ability to stimulate the body’s own collagen. In taking of collagen supplements is also known to be responsible for producing elastin and fibrillin. These proteins help in structuring the skin.
                                  </p>

                                  <p>
                                      There are some other claims about this powerful protein that its supplements aid in reducing and preventing acne. However, these claims are not backed by scientific claims.

                                  <h3>Relief from joint pain</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      Collagen aids in strengthening your cartilage, a rubber like tissue for the protection of joints. When we grow old, the production of collagen is going to decrease as well and this may result in a degenerative disorder like osteoarthritis. A research has stated that regular intake of collagen supplements significantly reduces the symptoms of osteoarthritis and you fell less pain in joints.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                      A study involving 73 athletes, who were consuming 24 grams of collagen regularly for 24 weeks, felt a 
                                      sudden decrease in joint pain while walking and exercising. On the other hand, those athletes who did not 
                                      take it didn’t experience any difference in pain.
                                  </p>

                                  <p>
                                      Moving onto normal adults who consumed 2-2.5 grams of collagen everyday for 75 days were quite satisfied with the results as they didn’t have much pain in their joints. Reduction in pain enabled these adults to indulge in physical activities more than the ones who were not the part of this study.
                                  </p>


                                  <p>
                                      Leading researchers from all over the world are of the view that supplements taken may accumulate inside the cartilage and stimulate the body’s tissues to make its own collagen. This may result in lowering of inflammation, better joint support and less pain.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                      In case you are affected by pain and are looking for a way out, consume 8-12 grams of collagen supplement on daily basis for best results and considerable reduction in pain.
                                  </p>
                                  <h3>Prevention of bone loss</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      Our bones are made mostly of collagen. This helps them keep strong and also gives them structure. While you grow old, the collagen level in the body starts deteriorating and so does the bone mass. Osteoporosis is the condition that may result from it. It signals towards low bone density and can also be responsible for bone fractures.
                                  </p>

                                  <p>
                                      One benefit of collagen supplements is that it helps to slow down the bone breakdown which may lead to osteoporosis. A study conducted on women who took calcium supplement in addition to 5 grams of collagen for 12 months showed great resistivity against bone problems and had more strength as compared to those who only consumed collagen, but no calcium.
                                  </p>

                                  <p>
                                      The results of this study was confirmed in another study which comprised of 66 women who consumed 5 grams of collagen regularly for one year. Those women who relied on collagen had 7% more bone mineral density (BMD) in contrast to women who only relied on collagen.
                                  </p>

                                  <p>
                                      BMD or bone mineral density calculates the amount of minerals like calcium in our bones. Lesser the BMD, more weak bones you have which may result in osteoporosis.
                                  </p>
                                  <h3>Helps in boosting muscle mass</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      Collagen comprises of 1-10% of the muscle tissue. The importance of this protein for our skin and body is great as it keeps the muscles strong and enables their proper functioning. Those people suffering from sarcopenia, a condition where muscle mass is lost due to age, are suggested to consume supplements of collagen because they aid in increasing the muscle mass.
                                  </p>

                                  <p>
                                      A study involving 27 frail men were given 15 grams of collagen coupled with regular exercise for 12 weeks showed great results as they gained more mass as opposed to those men who took part in the exercise program but didn’t take collagen in this period.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                      Researchers have found out that the intake of collagen considerably promotes the synthesis of muscle proteins like creatine, and it may also help you gain muscle mass after exercise.
                                  </p>
                                  <h3>Improves heart health</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      Researchers are of the view that collagen supplements are great for reducing the risk of cardiac issues. Collagen plays a vital role in providing structure to your arteries and vessels that take the blood from the heart to the rest of the body. With no or less collagen, the arteries tend to become weak and are unable to perform their role properly.
                                  </p>

                                  <p>
                                      Arteries becoming weak and fragile may result in narrowed arteries and this disease is known as atherosclerosis. This narrowing of arteries may lead to a heart attack.
                                  </p>

                                  <p>
                                      A study conducted on 31 healthy adults who were given 16 grams of collagen regularly for six months. At the end of this period, these adults experienced a significant improvement in artery stiffness as compared to the time when they were not consuming the collagen.
                                  </p>

                                  <p>
                                      Adding to that, these persons saw a boost in their levels of good HDL cholesterol by 6%. Known as good cholesterol, higher levels of HDL are better for heart health. HDL assists in removing the unwanted cholesterol from the blood stream. Higher the levels of HDL, lower the risks you have of heart diseases.
                                  </p>
                                  <h3>Other health benefits of collagen</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      There are a number of other health benefits associated with collagen supplements. Some of these are briefly described below
                                  </p>
                                  <h3>Hair and nails</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      Regular collagen intake may improve the strength of your nails as it puts a stop to brittleness. It may enable the nails the hair to grow stronger.
                                  </p>
                                  <h3>Gut health</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      Till now, no scientific research has come to the rescue of this claim but a number of health specialists advise collagen supplements for treating intestinal permeability or leaky gut syndrome.
                                  </p>
                                  <h3>Brain health</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      A vast majority of people who consume collagen regularly have showed a great improvement in their mood. Also, their anxiety level was reduced.
                                  </p>
                                  <h3>Weight loss</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      Although not proven scientifically, but some health practitioners deem collagen useful for weight loss and a faster metabolism.
                                  </p>

                                  <p>
                                      Let’s now inform you about the foods that contain collagen.
                                  </p>
                                  <h3>Collagen containing foods</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      Collagen is known to be present in the connective tissues of the animals. Food like pork skin, chicken, beef and fish are great sources which can be trusted for collagen.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                      Gelatin containing foods like bone broth is also rich in collagen.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                      Leafy greens and citrus fruits like lemon and oranges are believed to be rich in collagen. Foods that are rich in vitamin C must be used in case you want to benefit from collagen.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                      Other plants that are considered to be rich in collagen are:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                              Algae
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                              Ginseng
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                              Cilantro or the coriander leaves
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                      More extensive scientific research is required to conclude whether consuming food rich in collagen increases the body’s own collagen or not. Also, it has not yet been found out that which form of collagen is more beneficial; collagen present in foods or supplements containing collagen.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                      Collagen found in foods is broken down into peptides and amino acids by digestive systems.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                      However, the collagen in supplement is already broken down. This is the reason many believe that collagen supplements are absorbed better as compared to collagen present in the foods.
                                  </p>
                                  <h3>Side-effects of collagen</h3>
                                  <p>
                                      Although, there aren’t any reasons for which the intake of collagen must be stopped, however, there are supplements that are prepared from food allergens like fish, shellfish and eggs. So, collagen supplements made using these ingredients are definitely not for people who are suffering from allergies.
