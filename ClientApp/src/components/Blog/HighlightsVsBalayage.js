                                    <p>Let’s start by telling you what these techniques actually are:</p>

                                    <h3>Balayage?</h3>
                                    <h6>History</h6>
                                    <p>
                                       Talking about the word Balayage and a bit about its history
                                         as a hair coloring technique, it originated from the French 
                                        language which means ‘to sweep’. It came onto the scene as a 
                                        hair coloring technique in the decade of 70s and made its 
                                        way into the American hair industry in the early 90s. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>What is Balayage?</h3>

                                    <p>
                                        You might have heard or read this word, “Balayage” many times
                                        either on the internet or on magazines on the shelves of a
                                        salon/spa. However, are you aware of what does it mean and
                                        what actually is <strong>full head balayage?</strong>  </p>


                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Balayage</strong> is basically a hair coloring technique where the
                                        colorist uses a sweeping motion while applying color to the
                                        client’s hair. This technique of painting dye on the hair is
                                        done in such a way that it gives the hair a natural-looking
                                        effect from root till the tip. Simply saying <strong>Balayage
                                        highlights on dark hair</strong> makes beautiful blends of
                                        multi-dimensional color.  </p>

                                    
                                    <p>Hair Balayage became popular because the people could get contrasting
                                        colored ends that blended perfectly with their natural hairs. Let it 
                                        be half or <strong>full head balayage</strong>, this technique seems to be quite easy, 
                                        however, in reality, it isn’t. It requires a specialist to do the job 
                                        who has an eye for details can do it in the right way. It’s the 
                                        responsibility of the hairstylist to observe your hair’s natural 
                                        texture, movement and then apply the color in a way that the color 
                                        seems to be natural or quite close to it. 
                                        </p>

                                    
                                    <p>
                                       Let’s now move on the other technique named Hair Highlights.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>What are Highlights?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        According to experts, Hair Highlights have been around for 
                                        ages and no one can exactly tell when they were invented. 
                                        However, a lot of people are of the view that it came from 
                                        Ancient Greece and the first <strong>full head Highlights</strong> technique
                                        was developed around 4 B.C!
                                    </p>

                                    
                                    <p>
                                       It is believed that the first bleach got used in Highlights
                                         was a blend of gold flakes, olive oil and pollen found 
                                        locally. A lot of people when hear about this, wish their
                                        hair could be covered in gold flakes; off course it takes
                                        a lot of money. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Once this expensive mixture was applied to a person’s hair,
                                        they would have definitely sunbathed for hours. 
                                        Understandably so, this method seems to be quite a 
                                        time consuming and some people also call it ineffective, 
                                        but some say that the antioxidants present in gold flakes 
                                        can give the hair a glamorous and healthy look. 
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                       Be it effective or ineffective, people used the gold flakes 
                                         on their head for centuries. The modern full highlights 
                                        hair coloring technique that we are aware of came in the 
                                        early part of the 20th century. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                      <strong>Full Head Foil Highlights</strong> came onto the scene in the 1980s
                                          and this produced more natural-looking results as compared
                                        to the results gained by using highlighting caps. The caps
                                        that were used before the foils resembled the army helmets 
                                        used in the world wars; seemed a bit weird. 
                                    </p>


                                    <p>
                                        Hairstylists prefer foils instead of caps because this gives 
                                        them the liberty of coming up with alluring and eye-catching 
                                        looks for every client. The best advantage of foil that 
                                        makes it the first choice ahead of highlighting cap is that 
                                        it gives the stylists the ability to pick placement of 
                                        highlights quite meticulously. However, until the foils 
                                        were invented the caps were really restrictive. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                       Let it be <strong>full or half head Highlights</strong>, they are known to
                                         give your hair a lovely look and dimension. If you 
                                        are one of those people who have naturally solid 
                                        colored hair, then Highlights can change the appearance 
                                        in a pleasant way. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>If you have blonde hair and want to energize your looks, you can go for low
                                        lights on highlighted hair to add a bit of flair. Low lights, the name
                                        perfectly describes what it does, are quite the same as Highlighting,
                                        however, here the colorist mostly uses a dark color in place of bleach. </p>

                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Low lights are a wonderful way to slowly shift to dark hair
                                        or in case you are looking for a change for a short while. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Difference between Balayage and Highlights</h3>
                                    <h5>Balayage</h5>
                                    <p>
                                        The main reason why people go for Balalyage is that it requires 
                                        little to no maintenance. When compared to Highlights, Balayage 
                                        doesn’t leave a demarcation even when your hairs start growing.
                                        This allows you to take breaks of your choice between appointments. You may also go for a toner service 6 weeks after you get Balayage treatment; it’s easy and cheap as well. 
                                    </p>


                                    <p>
                                        If you are unclear about toner, let us tell you. It is a glaze of color that retains the essence
                                        of hair color and helps to prevent it from getting brassy or ashy without the usage of cream color. 
                                        This attribute makes toners a crucial part of hair color and they help in maintaining a blonde look of your hair, forever.

                                    </p>



                                    <p>
                                       The time when combined with the color to give you 
                                         the desired look may cost you between £ 135 to £170. 
                                    </p>

                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Let’s now talk about Highlights. Be it half or <strong>full head Highlights</strong>, they require excessive maintenance.
                                        If you are at the salon for the hair Highlighting, the stylist may recommend you to come back
                                        after every 6 weeks to have them retouched. In case you don’t go for regular treatments, they
                                        will become noticeable as soon as you opt for a retouch. 
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        When it comes to pricing, Highlights are more costly as compared to Balayage. One thing to note here for all those who
                                        are interested in Highlights, but stop themselves when the thoughts of it being an expensive one 
                                        come to their mind, is that Partial Highlight is a quite common Highlighting service and it won’t 
                                        charge you more than £80 to £100, depending on the location of the salon/spa, the experience of the

                                        to your hair. Bleaching your hair excessively and on a regular basis 
                                        causes it to dry, become brittle and results in breakage.
