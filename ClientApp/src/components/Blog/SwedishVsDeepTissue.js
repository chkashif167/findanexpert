                              <h3>Swedish Massage Treatment</h3>
                              <p>
                                Swedish massage is often called a classic massage. This famous western style massage is a commonly performed bodywork to endow relaxation to the entire human body by releasing muscle tension. When compared with <strong>Deep Tissue Massage techniques</strong>, it is gentle, soft and perfect for those who want to ease the muscle tension and are seeking relaxation and calmness.   
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 Swedish technique or rubbing is quite popular for loosening of tight muscles and muscle soreness. These could be caused by spending a considerable amount of time in front of a computer or by doing heavy exercises. People who experience tension in their lower backs, shoulder and neck are advised to go for <strong>Swedish Full body Massage</strong>.
                              </p>
                              <h3>How Swedish Massage is done?</h3>
                              <p>
                                 While this therapy is done, the <strong>Swedish Massage therapist</strong> uses kneading, deep circular movements, passive joint movements and long strokes. All these movements have one combined purpose, which is to provide relaxation, ease the flow of blood and lymph drainage.  
                              </p>
                  
                              <p>
                                 Normally a <strong>Swedish Massage procedure</strong> involves the entire body. While starting, the therapist will ask you to lie either on your back or stomach and then you will have to flip over at the halfway stage. In case, any particular area of your body like tight neck or shoulders are a point of concern, you can ask the specialist to focus a bit more on this area.  
                              </p>
                  
                              <p>
                                 Also, you can demand any amount of pressure to be applied to your body like light, medium or firm pressure. 
                              </p>

                              <h3>What happens during a Swedish Massage?</h3>
                              <p>
                                Like all full-body massages, you will have to be undressed before lying on the massage sheet or bed. You have the option of continuing the procedure by keeping your underwear on. Once, you are ready, the massage specialist will drape a sheet of cloth on your body and they will keep on pulling it back and adjust it over your body as they work their way around. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                No need to worry as your private parts are covered all the time. For easing the long strokes and circular movements, the <strong>Swedish Massage therapist</strong> will use oil or lotion. You can also ask for your preferred scent or aromatherapy. 
                              </p>
                              <h3>Deep Tissue Massage</h3>
                              <p>
                                Although there are some similarities between the two,<strong> Deep Tissue Massage</strong> technique which is also known as Balinese Massage or Scar tissue Massage goes a bit further than Swedish massage. It targets the inner layers of the muscles, muscle knots like adhesions, tendons and fascia.  
                              </p>
                  
                              <p>
                                <strong>Deep Tissue Massage techniques</strong> involve the same kind of strokes and kneading movements as Swedish massage does, however, the pressure used in the former is more intense and it can be painful as well.  
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                Deep Tissue Massage is considered ideal for sports personnel, runners and people suffering from injuries. People suffering from conditions of chronic pain like fibromyalgia and lower back pain are also advised to go for this treatment.  
                              </p>
                  
                              <p>
                                 This bodywork assists in healing by releasing tight tissues and muscles. Not only this, it also improves the blood flow to the soft tissues and helps in reducing the inflammation.  
                              </p>
                              <h3>What happens during a deep tissue massage?</h3>
                              <p>
                                A <strong>Deep Tissue Massage </strong> can either be applied on the full body or may focus on specific areas, depending on your needs. Before the procedure starts the therapist will discuss the problematic areas, which need more attention, with you. The process starts with you lying on your back or stomach and the level of undressing totally depends on you and whether you are going for a full body massage or not.   
                              </p>
                  
                              <p>
                                It all begins with a traditional relaxation massage which serves as the muscle warmer. Now that the muscles are warmed, the massage specialist will increase the pressure onto the areas that need more care. Palms, fingertips and knuckles are used to apply pressure which are backed up by the fore arms and elbows of the <strong>Deep Tissue Massage therapist</strong>, to increase pressure. 
                              </p>
                  
                              <p>
                                 You need to talk to your therapist on the level of pressure you can endure. The level of pressure can be different depending on the area and the time as early on, there will be less pressure applied and gradually this pressure in increased. 
                              </p>
                  
                              <p>
                                 You can talk about the level of pressure with your therapist before and even during the massage. After the procedure is done, you may experience soreness in the days to come. Ice, heat and stretching are recommended by the therapist to counter the soreness and bit of pain, if any.  
                              </p>
                              <h3>Who is it suitable for?</h3>

                              <p>
                                  Start searching for a therapist who specializes in the form of bodywork you are interested in. The therapist must also indentify the specific type of massage that: 
                                  <ul>
                                     <li>
                                       Caters to the problems you are suffering from</li>

                                  </ul> 
                              </p>
                 
                              <p>
                                Make sure, you opt for an experienced person who possesses expertise in treating you in different conditions like sports injuries, muscle tightening, fibromyalgia, arthritis and pregnancy etc. don’t forget to check for their license and certifications.

                              <h3>Discuss any injuries that bother you</h3>
                              <p>
                                 Don’t be afraid to discuss your injuries, their type and the severity of them with your therapist. Remember to mention the current pain levels you are bearing and how long they have been healing.  
                              </p>
                              <h3>Inform them about your comfort levels</h3>
                              <p>
                                 Take about the areas that you don’t want them to touch. A large majority of people don’t want the therapist to touch their buttocks and inner thighs etc.  
                              </p>
                              <h3>Tell them what you want to achieve</h3>

                                 Don’t forget to talk about the pressure that you can tolerate.  
                              </p>
                              <h3>Warm up</h3>
                              <p>
                                 This can be done by taking a warm shower, spending sometime in the sauna and soaking your body in a hot tub. Some specialists encourage a bit of exercise for warming up your muscles. It’s better to talk to the therapist before the procedure starts.   
                              </p>

                                Plenty of fluids and water are beneficial before the <strong>Deep Tissue massage</strong>. Experts suggest that your stomach must be empty before going for a massage; however, drinking a couple of glasses of water is great.

                              <h3>Which is more beneficial? Swedish or Deep tissue massage</h3>
                              <p>
                                Both the types are quite similar; however, the pressure level in both the techniques is what matters a lot. <strong>Deep Tissue Massage techniques</strong> involve a bit more pressure as compared to <strong>Swedish massage treatment</strong>.

                                 If you want relaxation, calmness, and emancipation from tense and tight muscles, Swedish massage is the best technique. On the other hand, if your are recovering from an injury or want to get rid of an injury quickly, <strong>Deep Tissue Massage</strong> is the best technique in this situation.
